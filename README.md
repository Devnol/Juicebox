Miniature IP5328P-based dual 18650 powerbank

Why buy a fire hazard when you can make one? 18650 cells are readily available and cheap (especially if you hate having insurance) and aliexpress is full of questionably designed driver boards.
Juicebox combines these two exhilarating ways of life into a handy miniature package the size of a small frag grenade
